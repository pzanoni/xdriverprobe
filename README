xdriverprobe: probe Xorg drivers to check for supported video cards

There are two main purposes for this program:
- to check if any of the devices present in your machine are supported by the
  Xorg video drivers
- to print a list of PCI ids supported by each Xorg video driver

You can tell it to look for a specific driver and you can also pass a different
place to look for the video drivers.  There's also a verbose mode.

Main use cases:
"xdriverprobe": prints the names of the drivers that support your video cards
and the device id and vendor id of the supported devices
"xdriverprobe -o supported": prints a list of supported devices for each video
driver
"xdriverprobe -h": lists the other options!

= Compiling =

There are 2 autoconf options you can pass:
--with-module-dir: pass a different Xorg module dir (the default one is the
  output of "pkg-config --variable=moduledir xorg-server")
--with-extra-module-dir: pass an extra Xorg module dir (the default is not
  having an extra module dir). This feature exists because some distros like
  Mandriva have more than one module dir (for drivers like fglrx).

= Problems =

- There are a few drivers I ignore for now: vmware, ati, sisusb, v4l, nvidia.
  Run "xdriverprobe -d nameoftheignoreddriver" to bypass the ignore. You'll
  probably get segfaults. Note: ignoring ati is not a problem since I don't
  ignore radeon and its other children
- I tried to add the smallest amount of symbols possible to symbols.c, so you
  might get an "undefined symbol" error. Please report those so I can fix them.
- This program was almost not tested
