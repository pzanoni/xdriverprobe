xdriverprobe

This program does dlopen() on your video drivers and checks if any of them
support any devices of your machine. You can tell it to look for a specific
driver and you can also pass a different place to look for the video drivers.
There's also a verbose mode.

The output is:
(video driver) (vendor id):(device id) (probing method)

= Compiling =

There are 2 autoconf options you can pass:
--with-module-dir: pass a different Xorg module dir (the default one is the
  output of "pkg-config --variable=moduledir xorg-server")
--with-extra-module-dir: pass an extra Xorg module dir (the default is not
  having an extra module dir). This feature exists because some distros like
  Mandriva have more than one module dir (for drivers like fglrx).

= Problems =

- There are a few drivers I ignore for now: vmware, ati, sisusb, v4l
- Driver "nvidia" is not behaving correctly, probably because it calls
  LoaderSymbol and we return NULL.
- Drivers that load submodules (like cirrus) also don't quite work
- I tried to add the smallest amount of symbols possible to symbols.c, so you
  might get an "undefined symbol" error. Please report those so I can fix them.
- This program was almost not tested
